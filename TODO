use explicit specialization to handle primitive/string list/dictionaries

document text->string class conversion
document/comment list and dictionary classes
document filedescriptor,file,stringbuffer,variablebuffer,
		hostentry,protocolentry,passwdentry,groupentry
document clienttransport/namevaluepairs relationship
document new read-til-terminate method in transport class
rebuild class doc's

need generic parser/lexer classes, use them for xmlsax
probably can combine memorypool and variablebuffer classes
xmldomnode should probably use list class
should be able to validate an xml document against the dtd

naming convention should support tcp/udp/etc sockets and non-stream tcp sockets
	ie: protocol-type-domain-client/server-socket
	eg: tcpstreaminetclientsocket
test invalid xml

handle CDATA/internal subsets better
is xmldom really DOM compliant?

support non-posix semaphores
handoff fails on Redhat 5.2, SCO, alpha - SCO problem appears to be 
						alignment-related
