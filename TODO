freebsd IPV6_V6ONLY??? socket option
sysctl on netbsd?

these classes would be nice:
	table
	termios
	thread
	networkinterfaces (stubbed out)
	shellcommand (stubbed out)
	dirent/direct wrapper
need generic parser/lexer classes, use them for xmlsax
probably can combine memorypool and variablebuffer classes
xmldom should support xpath
xmldomnode should probably use list class
should be able to validate an xml document against the dtd
dtd class needs to store +/* child element modifiers

naming convention should support tcp/udp/etc sockets and non-stream tcp sockets
	ie: protocol-type-domain-client/server-socket
	eg: tcpstreaminetclientsocket
test invalid xml

handle CDATA/internal subsets better
is xmldom really DOM compliant?
xml classes need to support entities defined in the DOCTYPE declaration
xml comment problem?

support non-posix semaphores
handoff fails on Redhat 5.2, SCO, alpha - SCO problem appears to be
