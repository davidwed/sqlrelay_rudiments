add xnet/socket/nsl/etc. libs to rudiments-config --libs

get epoch from string doesn't work right on solaris x86

test blocking/nonblocking mode switch functions

send/sendto/sendmsg and recv/recvfrom/recvmsg methods for socket class

freebsd IPV6_V6ONLY??? socket option
sysctl on netbsd?

these classes would be nice:
	table
	termios
	thread
	networkinterfaces (stubbed out)
	shellcommand (stubbed out)
	dirent/direct wrapper
need generic parser/lexer classes, use them for xmlsax
probably can combine memorypool and variablebuffer classes
xmldom should support xpath
xmldomnode should probably use list class
should be able to validate an xml document against the dtd
dtd class needs to store +/* child element modifiers

support tcp/udp/etc. sockets and non-stream tcp sockets
test invalid xml

handle CDATA/internal subsets better
is xmldom really DOM compliant?
xml classes need to support entities defined in the DOCTYPE declaration

support non-posix semaphores
handoff fails on Redhat 5.2, SCO, alpha - SCO problem appears to be 
						alignment-related

Pie in the sky:
Is it possible to implement a scheme for class versioning, where classes can
	be modified through some process without breaking binary compatibility?
	(can each class keep an array of pointers, 1 to each version of the
		class, then can we override the -> operator to select the
		proper version?)
Is it possible to implement a generic garbage collection scheme without a vm but
	still retain the ability to manually manage memory?
	(maybe: "yes, use static instances of classes when
			you want garbage collection")
Implement functions for easily calling functions from other languages.
	ie.  call("perl","method","param1","param2",...);
	ie.  call("java","method","param1","param2",...);
	ie.  call("python","method","param1","param2",...);
	etc...
	or something
Class serialization.
