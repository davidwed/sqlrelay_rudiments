a table class would be nice
a termios class would be nice
a thread class would be nice
need generic parser/lexer classes, use them for xmlsax
probably can combine memorypool and variablebuffer classes
xmldomnode should probably use list class
should be able to validate an xml document against the dtd

	ie: protocol-type-domain-client/server-socket
	eg: tcpstreaminetclientsocket

handle CDATA/internal subsets better
is xmldom really DOM compliant?
xml classes need to support entities defined in the DOCTYPE declaration
xml comment problem?

support non-posix semaphores
handoff fails on Redhat 5.2, SCO, alpha - SCO problem appears to be 
						alignment-related
