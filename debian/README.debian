librudiments for DEBIAN
-----------------------

Librudiments is a prerequisite for sqlrelay.

The development package librudiments-0.25-1-dev contains a profiling
version named librudiments_p (.so and .a).

Librudiments is compiled with g++ 3.0; in fact, it doesn't compile
with 2.95. Thus, you will have to use 3.0 for your own projects based
on librudiments.
