<span class="heading">Using the memorypool class</span><br><br>

<p>The <a href="../classes/html/classmemorypool.html">memorypool class</a> provides methods for creating and using a memory pool.</p>

<p>If you have an iterative process that requires variable amounts of memory for each iteration, using a memory pool can perform better than allocating memory on-demand and consume less memory than allocating static buffers that are large enough to accommodate the maximum amount of data you may have to store.</p>
