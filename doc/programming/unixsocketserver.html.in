<span class="heading">Using the unixsocketserver class</span><br><br>

<p>Daemons are commonly used to serve data to clients over a network but they can also be used to serve data to processes running on the local machine.  This can be done using the inetsocketserver class but if your platform supports unix sockets, then it can be done much faster and more efficiently using the unixsocketserver class.  The example below listens on an unix socket for a client connection, receives a string from the client and writes the same string back to the client.</p>

<p>See the <a href="inetsocketclient.html">inetsocketclient</a> example for a client that can communicate with this server.</p>
