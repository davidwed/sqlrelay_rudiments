<span class="heading">Using the cignal classes</span><br><br>

<p>Signals allow processes to interrupt the execution of other processes.  Signal handlers allow processes to intercept and react to the signals sent to them.</p>

<p>Rudiments provides 3 classes for working with signals: signalset, signalmanager and signalhandler.

<p>A signalset is just a collection of signals.  The signalset class allows a programmer to build up a collection of signals.</p>

<p>The signalmanager class provides methods for sending signals, ignoring signals, waiting for signals and examining blocked signals.</p>

<p>The signalhandler class provides methods for catching and handling signals.</p>

<p>Below is some code illustrating the use of all three classes.  Note that you'll have to kill this program with a -9.</p>
