<span class="heading">Using the character class</span><br><br>

<p>The <a href="../classes/html/classcharacter.h">character class</a> provides static methods for evaluating and manipulating characters.</p>

<p>Methods are provided for determining if a character is alphabetic, alphanumeric, lower case, upper case, etc.</p>

<p>Methods are also provided for transforming the character to upper or lower case, and to 7-bit ascii, by stripping off the high order bit.</p>

<blockquote class="code">
@character-toxxx.cpp.html@
</blockquote>

<p>An inSet() method is also provided which returns true if the specified character is in the specified set of characters and false otherwise.</p>
