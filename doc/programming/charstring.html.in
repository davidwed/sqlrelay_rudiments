<span class="heading">Using the charstring class</span><br><br>

<p>The <a href="../classes/html/classcharstring.html">charstring class</a> provides static methods for manipulating C-style character strings.</p>

<p>In addition to some unique methods, analogs for the standard C string functions are provided.  However, unline the standard C string functions, the charstring methods are NULL safe.  Your application will not crash if a NULL is passed in for a string, and instead, give intuitive results.</p>

<p>The charstring class provides methods for zeroing, duplicating, appending and copying data to character strings, and determining their lengths.</p>

<p>The charstring class also provides methods for performing various character string comparisons.</p>

<p>The charstring class also provides methods for finding characters or other character strings within character strings.</p>

<p>The findFirst()/findFirstOfSet() and findLast() methods return the first/last instance of a character/string/set within a string, or NULL if no match is found.</p>
