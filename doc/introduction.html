<span class="heading">Introduction to Rudiments</span><br><br>

<p>In the early days of
<a href="http://www.firstworks.com/sqlrelay.html"><b>SQL Relay</b></a>
and <a href="http://www.firstworks.com/groundwork.html"><b>Groundwork</b></a>, some of the
classes being developed for each project didn't exactly fit.  
Or more precisely, could concievably be useful in other projects.  
Some of these classes were very generic
base classes, others were utilities.  The older the projects got, the
more obvious it became that these classes should be extracted and assembled
into a library of their own.</p>

<p><b>Rudiments</b> was born.</p>

<p>As a result, some of the <b>rudiments</b> classes are fairly full featured
and others very incomplete; containing only the functions that were required
by the project they were derived from.</p>

<p><b>Rudiments</b> is very much a 
work in progress, and not extremely well defined at that.  Currently though,
the objective of the project is to develop a set of utility classes that 
provide the functionality of the standard C libraries through an object
oriented interface and a set of useful base classes for some standard kinds of
programs.</p>
