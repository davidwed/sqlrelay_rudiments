<a name="platforms"></a>
<span class="heading2">Platforms</span>

<p>Rudiments is supported on a variety of Linux/Unix systems and Windows.  Building Rudiments on these platforms requires the installation of a compiler toolchain and other bits of optional software.  Instructions follow for many supported platforms.</p>


<a name="linux"></a>
<span class="heading3">Linux</span>

<p>Rudiments is supported on a variety of Linux platforms including Fedora, CentOS, OpenSuSE, Debian, and Ubuntu.</p>


<a name="fedora"></a>
<span class="heading4">Fedora</span>

<blockquote>

<p>To install all of the prerequisites at once, execute the following command, as root:</p>

<pre class="code">
dnf -y install gcc-c++ make openssl-devel krb5-devel pcre-devel libcurl-devel</pre>

<p>The gcc-c++ and make packages are required, but the rest are optional and may be omitted as appropriate.  For example, if you don't need PCRE support, then you can omit the pcre-devel package.</p>

<p>Note that on older Fedora platforms, the yum package manager is used instead of the dnf package manager.  The syntax for the two is the same though, just replace dnf with yum in the command above.</p>

<a name="centos"></a>
<span class="heading4">CentOS</span>

<blockquote>

<p>To install all of the prerequisites at once, execute the following command, as root:</p>

<a name="opensuse"></a>
<span class="heading4">OpenSuSE</span>

<blockquote>

<p>To install all of the prerequisites at once, execute the following command, as root:</p>

<pre class="code">
zypper install gcc-c++ make libopenssl-devel krb5-devel pcre-devel libcurl-devel</pre>

<p>The gcc-c++ and make packages are required, but the rest are optional and may be omitted as appropriate.  For example, if you don't need PCRE support, then you can omit the pcre-devel package.</p>

<a name="ubuntu"></a>
<span class="heading4">Ubuntu</span>

<blockquote>

<p>To install all of the prerequisites at once, execute the following command, as root:</p>

<pre class="code">
apt-get install g++ make libssl-dev libkrb5-dev libpcre3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev</pre>

<p>The g++ and make packages are required, but the rest are optional and may be omitted as appropriate.  For example, if you don't need PCRE support, then you can omit the libpcre3-dev package.</p>

</blockquote>

<span class="heading4">Debian</span>

<blockquote>

<p>To install all of the prerequisites at once, execute the following command, as root:</p>

<p>Rudiments is supported on a variety of Unix platforms including FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Minix.</p>


<a name="freebsd"></a>
<span class="heading4">FreeBSD</span>

<blockquote>

<p>Note that on older FreeBSD platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>The pkgtools package manager is used instead of the pkg package manager and the syntax for the two is the different.  Replace "pkg install" with "pkg_add -r " in the command above.</li>
<li>Clang is not available, so clang must be replaced with g++.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kerberos/GSSAPI is installed as part of the base installation.</p>

<pre class="code">
installpath = ftp://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/5.8/packages/amd64/
</pre>

<p>(replacing 5.8 with the version of OpenBSD that you are using and replacing amd64 with the architecture given by uname -m)</p>

<a name="windows"></a>
<span class="heading3">Windows</span>

<blockquote>

<p>Rudiments is supported on a variety of Windows platforms.  Building Rudiments on these platforms just requires the installation of a compiler toolchain.</p>
