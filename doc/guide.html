<span class="heading">Rudiments Guide</span><br><br>

<span class="heading">Downloading Rudiments:</span><br><br>
<p>You can download the most current source distribution of <b>rudiments</b> 
from <a href="http://www.firstworks.com/">http://www.firstworks.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you intend to build on Unix or Linux then download the tar.gz 
file.  For a native Windows installation, download the zip file.</p>

<span class="heading">Unpacking Rudiments:</span><br><br>

<p>To unpack the distribution on Unix or Linux, copy the file to a 
location on your machine that you have access to and execute the 
following commands:</p><p>

</p><ul>
<li>gunzip rudiments-X.XX.tar.gz</li>
<li>tar xf rudiments-X.XX.tar</li>
</ul>

<p>This will create a rudiments-X.XX directory. Change directories into that 
directory.</p>

<p>To unpack the distribution on Windows, move the zip file to your 
desktop or a location on your machine that you have read/write access, 
right click on the file and select "Extract All".</p>

<p>This will create a rudiments-X.XX folder.</p>

<span class="heading">Compiling Rudiments:</span><br><br>

<p>To compile <b>Rudiments</b> on Unix or Linux, read the INSTALL file, 
then execute the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>configure</li>
<li>make</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Rudiments</b> should compile and function on unix-based systems
using the GNU development system.  Other compilers may work too but have not
been tested on the current version.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> to compile on Cygwin, the <b>file</b> command must be present.  If it is not, the build will fail and you will get a very cryptic error.</p>

<p>The native Windows build process for Rudiments is currently somewhat primitive.</p>

<p>If you are running Windows Vista or higher, as a non-Administrator 
users, you must first create the folder C:\Program Files\Firstworks and 
give yourself full access permissions.  This step is necessary if you 
are running as the Administrator or if you're running an older version 
of Windows.</p>

<p>Now, to build and install Rudiments, open the Visual Studio Command 
Prompt and navigate to the base directory that was created when 
Rudiments was extracted.</p>

<p>There should be a file named <i>make.batch</i> in that directory.  Rename this file to <i>make.bat</i>.
  It is named with the .batch extension because various mail services 
don't allow .bat files to be emailed around, even if they are inside of 
an archive.  To get around this, the file must manually be renamed.  Now
 run:</p>

<blockquote><b>
make.bat
</b></blockquote>

<p>This should build and install Rudiments.  Various components will be 
installed under C:\Program Files\Firstworks.  If Rudiments is already 
installed there, the installation process will first remove it, then 
build it, then re-install it.</p>

<p>If you need to uninstall everything, just trash the C:\Program 
Files\Firstworks folder.  Note though that this will uninstall anything 
else in that folder (such as SQL Relay) as well.</p>

<span class="heading">Installing Rudiments:</span><br><br>

<p>On Windows, the build process should have also installed the software.  However, to install <b>Rudiments</b> on Linux or Unix, become root and execute:</p>

<ul>
<li>make install</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, everything is installed under /usr/local/firstworks.</p>

<p>To uninstall <b>Rudiments</b>, become root and execute:</p>

<ul>
<li>make uninstall</li>
</ul>
