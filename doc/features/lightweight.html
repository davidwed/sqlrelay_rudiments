<span class="header">Lightweight Implementation</span>

<p>Rudiments stays as close to native code as it can.  If the C library provides a function, then Rudiments wraps it as tightly as possible.  Few functions are re-implemented.</p>

<p>As a result, Rudiments itself is fairly small.  A default release build on x64 is around 500K.  A properly stripped arm-uclibc build with optimizations for small code is around 275K.</p>

<p>Rudiments doesn't go overboard with inlines either, so your application stays light as well.</p>
