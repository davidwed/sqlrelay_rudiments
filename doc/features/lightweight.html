<span class="header">Lightweight Implementation</span>

<p>Stays close to native code.  If the C library provides a function, then it gets used.  Minimal reinvention.</p>

<p>Default release build on x64 is around 500K.</p>
<p>A properly stripped arm-uclibc build with --enable-small code is around 275K.</p>

<p>Doesn't go overboard with inline code, so your app stays light too.</p>
