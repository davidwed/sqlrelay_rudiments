<a name="platforms"></a>
<span class="heading">Supported Platforms</span>

<p>Rudiments should build on relatively modern versions of Linux, Unix or Unix-like systems including Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X, Haiku and Cygwin.</p>

<p>x86 and x86_64 platforms are supported, as are non-x86 architectures such as ARM, Sparc, Mips, PPC and others.</p>

<p>uClibc/linux-based systems should also be supported.</p>

<p>Most of rudiments builds natively on Windows using Visual Studio but the server components to not yet build and many functions simply return failure.  Still, there is quite a bit that does work.</p>

<a name="prerequisites"></a>
<span class="heading">Prerequisites</span>

<p>To build on a unix-like platform, rudiments requires a working compiler toolchain and the make utility.  If OpenSSL and/or the Perl Compatible Regular Expression libraries are present then the build process will detect them and include support for them.</p>

<p>To build natively on Windows, you need to install Microsoft Visual Studio or Microsoft Visual Studio Express.</p>

<a name="downloading"></a>
<span class="heading">Downloading Rudiments</span>

<p>You can download the most current source distribution of <b>rudiments</b> from <a href="http://rudiments.sourceforge.net/">http://rudiments.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you intend to build on Unix or Linux then download the tar.gz file.  For a native Windows installation, download the zip file.</p>

<a name="extracting"></a>
<span class="heading">Extracting Rudiments</span>

<p>To extract the distribution on Unix or Linux, copy the file to a location on your machine that you have access to and execute the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>gunzip rudiments-X.XX.tar.gz</li>
<li>tar xf rudiments-X.XX.tar</li>
</ul>

<p>This will create a rudiments-X.XX directory. Change directories into that directory.</p>

<p>To extract the distribution on Windows, move the zip file to your desktop or a location on your machine that you have read/write access, right click on the file and select "Extract All".</p>

<p>This will create a rudiments-X.XX folder.</p>

<a name="building"></a>
<span class="heading">Building Rudiments</span>

<p>To build <b>Rudiments</b> on Unix or Linux, read the INSTALL file, then execute the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>configure</li>
<li>make</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Rudiments</b> should compile and function on unix-based systems using the GNU development system.  Other compilers may work too but have not been tested on the current version.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> to compile on Cygwin, the <b>file</b> command must be present.  If it is not, the build will fail and you will get a very cryptic error.</p>

<p>The native Windows build process for Rudiments is currently somewhat primitive.</p>

<p>If you are running Windows Vista or higher, as a non-Administrator users, you must first create the folder C:\Program Files\Firstworks and give yourself full access permissions.  This step is necessary if you are running as the Administrator or if you're running an older version of Windows.</p>

<p>Now, to build and install Rudiments, open the Visual Studio Command Prompt and navigate to the base directory that was created when Rudiments was extracted.</p>

<p>There should be a file named <i>make.batch</i> in that directory.  Rename this file to <i>make.bat</i>.  It is named with the .batch extension because various mail services don't allow .bat files to be emailed around, even if they are inside of an archive.  To get around this, the file must manually be renamed.  Now run:</p>

<blockquote><pre><b>
make
make install
</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>This should build and install Rudiments.  Various components will be installed under C:\Program Files\Firstworks.  If Rudiments is already installed there, the installation process will first remove it, then build it, then re-install it.</p>

<p>If you need to uninstall everything, just trash the C:\Program Files\Firstworks folder.  Note though that this will uninstall anything else in that folder (such as SQL Relay) as well.</p>

<a name="installing"></a>
<span class="heading">Installing Rudiments</span>

<p>On Windows, the build process should have also installed the software.  However, to install <b>Rudiments</b> on Linux or Unix, become root and execute:</p>

<ul>
<li>make install</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, everything is installed under /usr/local/firstworks.</p>

<p>To uninstall <b>Rudiments</b>, become root and execute:</p>

<ul>
<li>make uninstall</li>
</ul>
