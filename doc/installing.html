<a name="platforms"></a>
<span class="heading2">Supported Platforms</span>

<p>Rudiments should build on relatively modern versions of Linux, Unix or Unix-like systems including Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X, Haiku and Cygwin.</p>

<p>x86 and x86_64 platforms are supported, as are non-x86 architectures such as ARM, Sparc, Mips, PPC and others.</p>

<p>uClibc/linux-based systems are also supported.</p>

<p>Most of Rudiments builds natively on Windows using Visual Studio.  Everything isn't implemented yet, but there is quite a bit that does work.</p>

<a name="prerequisites"></a>
<span class="heading2">Prerequisites</span>

<p>To build on a unix-like platform, Rudiments requires a working compiler toolchain and the make utility.</p>

<p>If OpenSSL and/or the Perl Compatible Regular Expression libraries are present then the build process will detect them and include support for them but they are not required.</p>

<p>To build natively on Windows, you need to install Microsoft Visual Studio or Microsoft Visual Studio Express.</p>

<a name="unixlinux"></a>
<span class="heading1">Installation on Linux, Unix or Unix-like Platforms</span><br><br>


<a name="downloading"></a>
<span class="heading2">Downloading Rudiments</span>

<p>You can download the most current source distribution of Rudiments from <a href="http://rudiments.sourceforge.net/">http://rudiments.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<p>For Linux, Unix or Cygwin installations, download the tar.gz file.</p>


<a name="extracting"></a>
<span class="heading2">Extracting Rudiments</span>

<p>To extract the distribution on Unix or Linux, move the file to a location on your machine that you have read/write access to and execute the following commands:</p>

<blockquote><b>
gunzip rudiments-X.XX.tar.gz<br>
tar xf rudiments-X.XX.tar
</b></blockquote>

<p>(Where X.XX is replaced with the version of Rudiments that you downloaded.)</p>

<p>This will create a rudiments-X.XX directory.</p>


<a name="building"></a>
<span class="heading2">Building Rudiments</span>

<p>To build Rudiments, navigate to the directory that was created by the extraction and execute the following commands:</p>

<blockquote><b>
configure<br>
make
</b></blockquote>

<p>The configure script takes lots of command line options, most of which tell it which features to enable or disable or where to find prerequisite software in case any of it is installed in non-standard locations.  It also takes the --prefix option in case you want to install it somewhere other than /usr/local/firstworks.  For example:</p>

<blockquote><b>
configure --prefix=/usr/local
</b></blockquote>

<p>This invocation would cause the libraries to be installed in /usr/local/lib, the header files in /usr/local/include, the binaries and scripts to be installed in /usr/local/bin, etc.</p>

<p>There are also options for using cross-compilers and enabling debug and profiling.  To see the full list of available options, run:</p>

<blockquote><b>
configure --help
</b></blockquote>

<p>There are several things to note when using Cygwin.</p>

<ul>
<li>You must use the Cygwin shell to build SQL Relay, rather than the Windows Command Line or DOS prompt.</li>
<li>The <b>file</b> command must be present.  If it is not, the build will fail and you will get a very cryptic error.</li>
<li>SQL Relay cannot be built against non-Cygwin dll's.  You can't, for instance, build against the Oracle, Sybase, the native Windows version of MySQL or the native Windows versions of Perl, Python, PHP, etc.  Many languages and a few databases come with Cygwin though and others can be compiled from source under Cygwin.</li>
</ul>

<a name="installing"></a>
<span class="heading2">Installing Rudiments</span>

<p>By default, on Unix or Linux, everything is installed under /usr/local/firstworks by default.  You should either create that directory and give yourself full access permissions or install as root.</p>

<p>To install Rudiments run:</p>

<blockquote><b>
make install
</b></blockquote>

<p>To uninstall Rudiments run:</p>

<blockquote><b>
make uninstall
</b></blockquote>


<br>
<a name="windows"></a>
<span class="heading1">Installation on Windows</span><br><br>


<a name="windownloading"></a>
<span class="heading2">Downloading Rudiments</span>

<p>You can download the most current source distribution of Rudiments from <a href="http://rudiments.sourceforge.net/">http://rudiments.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you intend to build on Unix, Linux or Cygwin then download the tar.gz file.  For a native Windows installation, download the zip file.</p>

<a name="winextracting"></a>
<span class="heading2">Extracting Rudiments</span>

<p>To extract the distribution, move the zip file to your desktop or a location on your machine that you have read/write access, right click on the file and select "Extract All".</p>

<p>This will create a rudiments-X.XX directory where X.XX is replaced with the rudiments version number.</p>

<a name="winbuilding"></a>
<span class="heading2">Building Rudiments</span>

<p>To build Rudiments natively on Windows, open the Visual Studio Command Prompt and navigate to the directory that was created when Rudiments was extracted.</p>

<p>There should be a file named <i>make.batch</i> in that directory.  Rename this file to <i>make.bat</i>.  It is named with the .batch extension because various mail services don't allow .bat files to be emailed around, even if they are inside of an archive.  To get around this, the file must manually be renamed.</p>

<p>There are 4 build options.  Rudiments can be built as 32-bit or 64-bit binaries, and with or without Common Language Runtime (CLR) support.  There are advantages and disadvantages to building each way.</p>

<p>To build 32-bit without CLR support, run:</p>

<blockquote><b>
make
</b></blockquote>

<p>To build 32-bit with CLR support, run:</p>

<blockquote><b>
make clr
</b></blockquote>

<p>To build 64-bit without CLR support, run:</p>

<blockquote><b>
make 64
</b></blockquote>

<p>To build 64-bit with CLR support, run:</p>

<blockquote><b>
make clr64
</b></blockquote>

<a name="installing"></a>
<span class="heading2">Installing Rudiments</span>

<p>By default, on Windows, everything is installed under C:\Program Files\Firstworks for 64-bit builds or C:\Program Files (x86)\Firstworks for 32-bit builds.  You should either create that directory and give yourself full access permissions or install as Administrator.</p>

<p>To install 32-bit Rudiments run:</p>

<blockquote><b>
make install
</b></blockquote>

<p>To install 64-bit Rudiments run:</p>

<blockquote><b>
make install64
</b></blockquote>

<p>To uninstall Rudiments run:</p>

<blockquote><b>
make uninstall
</b></blockquote>
